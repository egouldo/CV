aboutme: "Elliot Gould is a PhD candidate at the School of BioSciences, and a Quantitative Research Assistant on the [repliCATS project](replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) at the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne. Their PhD investigates the transparency and reproducibility of ecological models in applied ecology and conservation decision-making. In their role as a Quantitative Research Assistant, Elliot has managed a small team of researchers to develop a data provisioning platform for the repliCATS project, and taken lead responsibility for data management, as well as contributing to research on metascience. They have an enthusiasm for teaching and skill-sharing, particularly with regard to building a strong community of practice in emerging open-science methodology and computational biology within ecology and conservation. Elliot has co-designed a learning and assessment module for the subject Vegetation Management and Conservation that aimed to teach recent developments in open-science practice whilst improving subject-specific learning outcomes. Elliotâ€™s primary research interest is in building ecological models for aiding ecological management and conservation decisions. Other research interests include decision-theory, Structured Decision Making, plant ecology (especially grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic Plains), data visualisation and building new tools for open-science."
