aboutme: "Elliot Gould is a PhD candidate at the School of EAgriculture, Food and Ecosystem Sciences, and a Quantitative Research Assistant on the [repliCATS project](replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) at the School of History and Philosophical Studies, University of Melbourne. Their PhD investigates the transparency and reproducibility of ecological models in applied ecology and conservation decision-making. In their role as a Quantitative Research Assistant, Elliot managed a small team of researchers to develop a data provisioning platform for the repliCATS project, and taken lead responsibility for data management, as well as contributing to research on metascience. They have an enthusiasm for teaching and skill-sharing, particularly with regard to building a strong community of practice in emerging open-science methodology and computational biology within ecology and conservation. Elliot's research seeks to use data science techniques to advance the open-science movement by improving transparency and reproducibility, focussing on ecology and conservation Science. Other research interests include decision-theory, Structured Decision Making, and plant ecology (especially grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic Plains)."
