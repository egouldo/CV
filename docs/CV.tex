\quote{Elliot Gould is a PhD candidate at the School of EAgriculture,
Food and Ecosystem Sciences, and a Quantitative Research Assistant on
the \href{replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/}{repliCATS project} at the
School of History and Philosophical Studies, University of Melbourne.
Their PhD investigates the transparency and reproducibility of
ecological models in applied ecology and conservation decision-making.
In their role as a Quantitative Research Assistant, Elliot managed a
small team of researchers to develop a data provisioning platform for
the repliCATS project, and taken lead responsibility for data
management, as well as contributing to research on metascience. They
have an enthusiasm for teaching and skill-sharing, particularly with
regard to building a strong community of practice in emerging
open-science methodology and computational biology within ecology and
conservation. Elliot's research seeks to use data science techniques to
advance the open-science movement by improving transparency and
reproducibility, focussing on ecology and conservation Science. Other
research interests include decision-theory, Structured Decision Making,
and plant ecology (especially grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic
Plains).}
