\quote{Elliot Gould is a PhD candidate at the School of Agriculture,
Food and Ecosystem Sciences, and a Quantitative Research Assistant on
the \href{replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/}{repliCATS project} at the
School of History and Philosophical Studies, University of Melbourne.
Their PhD investigates the transparency and reproducibility of
ecological models in applied ecology and conservation decision-making.
In their role as a Quantitative Research Assistant, Elliot managed a
small team of researchers to develop a data analytics and management
platform for the repliCATS project, and contributed to research on
metascience. They have an enthusiasm for teaching and skill-sharing,
particularly with regard to building a strong community of practice in
emerging open-science methodology and computational biology within
ecology and conservation. Elliot's research seeks to use data science
techniques to advance the open-science movement by improving
transparency and reproducibility, focussing on ecology and conservation
Science. Other research interests include decision-theory, Structured
Decision Making, and plant ecology (especially grasslands of the
Victorian Volcanic Plains).}
